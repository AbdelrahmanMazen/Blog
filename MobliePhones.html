    <header><h3> New Qualcom Snapdaragon 8 gen 2 </h3> </header>
    
    <section> <p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform is a high-end SoC for smartphones that was introduced in late 2022 and manufactured in 4 nm at TSMC (N4P). It integrates four different CPU clusters. A fast and big prime core.</p> <section>

    <section> <p>based on the ARM Cortex-X3 architecture and clocked at up to 3.2 GHz for 64 bit applications. Two more ARM Cortex-A715 based performance cores clocked at up to 2.8 GHz (also only for 64 bit apps). Two more Cortex-A710 performance cores at up to 2.8 GHz that can also be used for older apps and three efficiency cores (ARM Cortex-A510 with up to 2 GHz). All cores can use the shared 8 MB level 3 cache.</p> </section>

    <section> <p>Furthermore, the SoC integrates a X65 5G modem (up to 10 Gbps download), a LPDDR5 memory controller, Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3, and a Hexagon 800 DSP with a new AI engine. The integrated Adreno 730 is supposed to be up to 30% faster than the Adreno 730 in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.</p> </section>

    <section> <p>Qualcomm states that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is up to 20% faster in CPU and 30% faster in GPU performance compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. The AI performance is also up to 20% faster. The SoC is manufactured in 4 nm at TSMC and should be available in devices in early 2023.</p> </section>

    <section> <p>Thanks to the new architecture and high clock rates, the SD 8 Gen 2 is the fastest mobile CPU for Android based devices and is only topped by current Apple SoCs like the Apple A16</p> </section>

    <header><h3> How Does Amoled Works? </h3> </header>

    <section><p>Whilst Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode (AMOLED) may sound complicated it simply refers to the technology that is used to light up your phone screen.</p></section>   

    <section><p>The OLED part of AMOLED means that the display uses millions of microscopic LEDs (tiny lights) to redefine the colours you see on the screen. AMOLED displays can light up individual pixels offering sensational realistic colours and an incredible degree of colour clarity. This differs from an LCD screen which is back lit, meaning LCD displays have lower contrast ratios and less realistic images compared with AMOLED screens.</p></section>

    <section><p>An AMOLED screen is an advanced version of OLED that is thinner, lighter and more flexible than OLED displays. AMOLED technology can be easily embedded into a smartphone screen and has faster refresh rate compared to OLED screens, ensuring that you experience smoother motions, improved gaming performance and quality media downloads.</p></section>

    <section><p>The Dynamic AMOLED display is the next generation of Super AMOLED mobile screen technology that builds on the success of Super AMOLED. First released in 2019, Dynamic AMOLED is a Super AMOLED display with added HDR10+ certification for even greater brightness, colour and contrast.</p></section>

    <section><p>Dynamic AMOLED 2X is the latest and greatest generation of Dynamic AMOLED technology. Taking Dynamic AMOLED to even greater heights it offers the best in smartphone display technology. Dynamic Tone Mapping optimises colour and contrast to give 100% accurate DCI-P3 colour gamut and the ‘2X’ relates to the upgraded Hz - from 60Hz to an exceptional 120Hz ensuring super smooth scrolling and highly responsive movements - perfect for fast paced gaming and multitasking. You'll find Dynamic AMOLED 2X technology in the latest flagship Samsung phones including the exceptional Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold6 and Galaxy Z Flip6.</p></section>
