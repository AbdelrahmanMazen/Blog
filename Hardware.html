    <header><h2> What Is a Power Supply (PSU), and How Does It Work? </h2> </header>
    
    <section> <p> Power supplies appear everywhere, and knowing how they work will help you select the best application options. Whether you need high-voltage power on board a ship or need to plug in a notebook computer to charge, you need a power supply. Because not all models are the same, you need to know what makes an ac-dc power supply unique, how to choose the best supplies for your electrical devices, and much more. If you’ve ever had questions about how a power supply works, its definition, or what it does, discover the answers here. </p> <section>

    <section> <p> <Strong>What Is a Power Supply?</Strong> Do not confuse a power supply with a power source. The source is the origin of incoming electricity. The electricity source is usually an outlet, battery, or generator. The power supply converts the power from the source into the correct format and voltage. Because various options exist, the specific power supply function depends on whether it needs to regulate energy or convert power. To understand a power supply and its workings, you must know its parts and their contributions to the device’s operation, as discussed below. </p> </section>

    <section> <p><strong>What Does a Power Supply Do?</strong> Power supplies have essential functions found in all models with additional operations added depending on the device type. Power supplies may need to change voltage up or down, convert power to direct current, or regulate power for smoother outgoing voltage. These functions will help you choose which supply you need for your electrical needs. Getting a device with too many features could cost you more money than you need, but if you don’t get the features you require, you could damage the devices you need to power. </p> </section>

    <section> <p>Power supplies are primarily used for changing voltage. The power source has a steady output, regardless of the device that must be used. To prevent overload, power supplies step down the voltage—or, conversely, step it up—to match the device’s requirements.Too much power from a power supply can severely damage a device, but if it does not deliver enough voltage, the device will not operate as it should. Energy changing is the main task of power supplies, and the bulk of their construction comes from the transformer used to move the voltage up or down as needed.</p> </section>

    <section> <p>Basic power supplies will change the voltage and convert to DC power. These standard operations send unregulated voltage out of the power supply. Still, if you need regulated power, the devices have another step of regulating the voltage to smooth out waves. To discover more about how a PSU (power supply unit) works, read on to learn about the individual parts and their functions, which will clarify your view of the entire operation of the power unit.</p> </section>

    <header><h2>11 Basic Components of Computer Hardware: Tips for Technicians</h2> </header>

    <section><p>Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer. It refers to the computer system, especially those that form part of the central processing unit. Computer technicians should know the basic components of computer hardware and how to work with each part, including the motherboard, power supply, keyboard, mouse and monitor. In this article, we discuss what computer hardware is and the basic components of it along with how computer technicians can safely troubleshoot key parts of a personal computer.</p></section>   

    <section><p><strong>What is computer hardware?</strong> Computer hardware includes the physical components of a computer. Personal computers (PCs) are electronic devices that use microchips to process information and may include desktop computers, laptops or tablets. Since a computer comprises many hardware components, they work together and depend on each other to function properly.</p></section>

    <section><p>What are basic components of computer hardware? There are several basic components of computer hardware including: <strong>1. Central processing unit (CPU)</strong> The CPU controls the computer processes and communicates with the other components of a personal computer. A computer's CPU may be one of the most complicated parts of the computer because of its intricacies. If a computer is experiencing CPU issues, a computer technician may start by checking the fan and cleaning out any dust or debris inside the machine. Another step a computer technician may complete is verifying that power supply cables work. A CPU will not function properly unless it receives a signal from the power supply.<strong>2. Motherboard</strong> The motherboard provides the structure for all other components and connects them, while also providing a way to distribute power, deliver information and connect to devices such as a printer or mouse. It controls how data transfers and what type of monitor or screen device to use, for example. It houses the CPU, memory and secondary storage devices such as hard drives.The first thing that a computer technician may do to troubleshoot any motherboard issues is to take the PC apart and inspect all the connections for corrosion. They may also check the power supply and make sure the computer is receiving electricity. <strong>3. Random Access Memory (RAM)</strong> RAM is where data lives temporarily while it's being actively used by programs, such as when a user launches a computer application. A technician may know how to identify the type of RAM in a computer, how to replace it if it's defective and how to diagnose problems with copying data from one location in memory to another.A technician should have knowledge about the different RAMs that are available and they may also know what types of errors might affect a computer's RAM operation. A technician may backup all computer files before fixing RAM to avoid losing critical programs and documents.</p></section><section><p></p></h5></section>
