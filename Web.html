    <header><h3> Hostinger Review: Website Creation Made Easy </h3> </header>
    
    <section> <p>Hostinger is a fast-growing website that recently landed on the official list of WordPress.org recommended hosts. I’d spent a little bit of time fiddling with Hostinger tools before, and I wanted to build a deeper understanding of how -- and how well -- they work.</p> <section>

    <section> <p>To accomplish this, I purchased a Hostinger plan and tested the site creation tools for ease of use. I then hosted a test site for one week, using uptime monitoring and speed tests to determine server performance. Finally, I tested the customer service by reading the knowledge base and reaching out via live chat. You can learn more about the full process of how we test web hosting services.</p> </section>

    <section> <p>Overall, I was impressed by Hostinger’s offerings. Despite providing low prices, both for the introductory term and for renewal pricing, Hostinger packs a lot of value. It delivers excellent site creation and management tools, exceptional server performance and impressive security features. The only drawback is the mediocre customer service. This makes Hostinger a great choice for simple sites, especially for-fun hobby sites and blogs but can make it a poor choice for business sites.</p> </section>

    <section> <p>Shared hosting divides the bandwidth, processing power and storage of a web server -- a specialized computer built for hosting websites -- between many websites. Each website gets a predetermined percentage of these resources, limiting the number of pages your site can store and the monthly visitors it can accommodate. Shared hosting is typically good for small-to-medium websites with 1,000 to 2,000 pages and 10,000 to 400,000 monthly visitors.</p> </section>

    <section> <p>Hostinger accepts several payment methods including credit cards, PayPal and cryptocurrency. Most web hosts accept only credit cards, making this a notable feature.</p> </section>
