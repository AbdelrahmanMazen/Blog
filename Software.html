    <header><h3> Duolingo 101: How to learn a language on Duolingo </h3> </header>
    
    <section> <p>At Duolingo, we believe that learning a language should be fun! That's why we combine gamification with learning science—to keep you motivated while helping you reach your goals. We offer over 100 courses teaching 40+ languages, and each one brings you a new way to connect with the people and cultures you care about, all for free!</p> <section>

    <section> <p>First things first: Download the Duolingo app on your smartphone from the App Store or Google Play Store and pick a language to start your learning journey. (You can add more languages or check out our math and music courses later!)</p> </section>

    <section> <p>You'll be asked some questions about your motivations and goals, and you'll be able to turn on notifications so you can establish a study schedule. (Later, you can set the notification time in the settings menu.)</p> </section>

    <section> <p>You'll also decide whether you want to start from the very beginning of the course or if you already know some of the language and would like to take a placement test to skip some units to match what you already know. </p> </section>

    <section> <p>If you start from the beginning of a course, there are still some ways to skip ahead, one unit at a time. If you go for the placement test option, you'll still be able to review any lessons that Duolingo marked as complete, but you won't be able to “undo” your placement and start from scratch. Don't forget to create a profile to save your progress! This will also allow you to access your account on other devices.</p> </section>

    <header><h3> Explained: What is Facebook? </h3> </header>

    <section><p>Facebook is the latest in a long line of what we now know as “social networking” websites. But what sets it apart from the competitors, is its popularity. At last check, Facebook boasts over 2.23 billion active users. </p></section>   

    <section><p>Established in 2004, from the college dorm room of Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard student, the website is now worth billions of dollars and is one of the world’s most recognisable brands. It’s even had the Hollywood treatment, with The Social Network, a film exploring the site’s conception, released to wide acclaim in 2011. But, if you’re not quite on top of technology or are new to the internet, as a parent, or a teacher, you probably have a few questions.</p></section>

    <section><p>Facebook is a website which allows users, who sign-up for free profiles, to connect with friends, work colleagues or people they don’t know, online. It allows users to share pictures, music, videos, and articles, as well as their own thoughts and opinions with however many people they like.</p></section>

    <section><p>Once accepted, the two profiles are connected with both users able to see whatever the other person posts. “Facebookers” can post almost anything to their “timeline”, a snapshot of what is happening in their social circle at any given time, and can also enter private chat with other friends who are online.</p></section>

    <section><p>People with profiles list information about themselves. Whether it be what they work at, where they are studying, ages, or other personal details, many users post lots of information which is easily accessible to their friends and others. On top of this, users can “like” other pages which interest them. For example, a Liverpool FC supporter can follow the club by linking up with its Facebook page. There, the user can post comments and receive club updates, pictures etc.</p></section>
